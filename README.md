Kafka Real-Time Data Pipeline
Overview
This project demonstrates a real-time data pipeline using Kafka and Docker. The pipeline processes streaming data, performs basic transformations, and sends the processed data to a new Kafka topic.

Key Features

Kafka setup using Docker Compose.

Python-based Kafka consumer and producer for data processing.
Real-time processing with fault tolerance and scalability considerations.

Project Setup
Prerequisites

Docker Desktop installed on your system.
Python 3.8+ installed with pip.

Step-by-Step Setup

1. Clone the Repository
bash
Copy code
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd kafka_pipeline

2. Start Docker Containers
Run the following command to start Kafka and supporting services:
bash
Copy code
docker-compose up

3. Install Python Dependencies
Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:
bash
Copy code
pip install pipenv
pipenv install

4. Run the Kafka Consumer/Producer
Start the Python script to consume data from user-login topic, process it, and produce it to processed-login topic:
bash
Copy code
pipenv run python kafka_consumer.py


Pipeline Design
Data Flow

Data Generation:
A Dockerized producer generates sample messages to the user-login Kafka topic.
Data Consumption and Processing:
The Python consumer subscribes to user-login and performs basic transformations such as filtering and formatting.

Data Storage:
The processed data is sent to the processed-login Kafka topic.
Message Schema
Input Topic (user-login):
{
  "user_id": "424cdd21-063a-43a7-b91b-7ca1a833afae",
  "app_version": "2.3.0",
  "device_type": "android",
  "ip": "199.172.111.135",
  "locale": "RU",
  "device_id": "593-47-5928",
  "timestamp": "1694479551"
}

Output Topic (processed-login):
{
  "user_id": "424cdd21-063a-43a7-b91b-7ca1a833afae",
  "locale": "RU",
  "timestamp": "1694479551"
}

Scalability and Fault Tolerance

Scalability
Partition topics for parallel processing by multiple consumers.
Use a Kafka cluster with multiple brokers for load balancing.
Deploy the Python application in a distributed manner using Kubernetes or Docker Swarm.
Fault Tolerance
Enable Kafka's replication feature to prevent data loss.
Use try-except blocks in the Python code to handle message processing failures.
Implement dead-letter queues to store problematic messages.

Production Deployment Steps

Container Orchestration:
Deploy Kafka and other services using Kubernetes.
Use Helm charts for easy configuration.

Monitoring and Logging:
Integrate with Prometheus and Grafana for real-time monitoring.
Use ELK stack for centralized logging.

Security:
Enable TLS encryption for Kafka communication.
Use SASL for authentication.
Additional Components

Schema Registry:
Manage message schemas and enforce schema validation.

Load Balancer:
Deploy an external load balancer for high availability.

Storage:
Integrate with a database or data lake for long-term storage.
How to Scale with Growing Datasets
Increase Kafka partitions to parallelize processing.
Scale consumer instances horizontally.
Use Kafka Streams or Apache Flink for complex transformations and aggregations.
Optimize Kafka configurations for high-throughput workloads.
Running Tests

Use a test script to verify Kafka topics are functioning correctly:
python test_kafka_pipeline.py
Check logs for successful message processing.
